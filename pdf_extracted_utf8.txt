Working Student – AI Firmware & Edge ML,Perinet GmbH, Cottbus, Germany
○ Co-developedRAG-based conversational AIusing vector embeddings and semantic search, integrated
with real-time sensor streams (MQTT) for IoT/automotive scenarios.
○ Designedanomaly detection systemson distributed edge nodes using optimized ML models, enabling
privacy-preserving real-time inference on device data.
○ Containerized (Docker/LXC) and orchestratedViT/ML serviceswith Kubernetes for ARM-based
edge devices, achieving production-grade stability.
○ Built scalableGolangbackend APIs for AI service integration and contributed to CI/CD pipelines
(GitLab) for automated build, test, and deployment of ML components.
○ Optimized neural networks, including transformer-based models, for low-latency inference on ARM
hardware via quantization and efficient data pipelines.

production systems.
○ Gained experience with legacy systems and databases, strengthening debugging, reliability, and software
engineering fundamentals.
Key Projects
Content-Aware ViT Systems on Edge Devices,M.Sc. Thesis
○ ResearchingVision Transformer (ViT)optimization for content-aware processing on resource-
constrained edge hardware.
○ Implementing model compression techniques (pruning, quantization, distillation) to enable real-time
ViT inference with minimal latency/memory usage.
○ Developing an evaluation framework for ViT performance across edge scenarios, focusing on accu-
racy–latency trade-offs and deployment robustness.
